	<p>Senator Jeff Klein proposed new legislation requiring Herbalife Nutrition Clubs and other direct marketing companies to be transparent in their practices, especially when dealing with immigrant communities. </p>

	<p> At Wednesday’s press conference, the senator said that direct marketing companies are targeting specific groups of people. “What they’re really doing is targeting Latino communities all over the city,” said Senator Klein, showing the visual representation of the nutrition clubs on a map. </p>

	<p>According to the Herbalife website, the company was founded 35 years ago in Los Angeles. Founder Mark Hughes sold the program “out of the trunk of his car,” and since then, it has expanded to 93 countries worldwide. Independent sellers recruit people to their team in order to be promoted and receive exclusive benefits. </p>

	<p>Some of the legislation Klein introduced in the State Senate includes the Attorney General reviewing financial disclosures from franchisors, approval of company sales literature and that investors receive an “offering prospectus” in their native language. </p>

	<p>“We want to warn the public,” said Klein. “We want to make sure individuals know that this is nothing but a come on.” </p>

	<p>Others like Rogier van Vlissingen, Chairman of Bronx Community Board 9, have written articles to bring awareness to what he refers to as “pyramid schemes.” The chairman has written over 50 articles about Herbalife for the financial website Seeking Alpha. </p>

	<p> “The Department of Justice is still investigating it,” said van Vlissingen, who has been a vocal opponent of Herbalife for three years. “I’m disappointed that it [action] takes so long,” the chairman added. </p>

	<p> Van Vlissingen compared Herbalife to a Ponzi scheme, and said that individuals who participate in pyramid schemes should face serious consequences. “People need to go to jail, otherwise, they don’t stop,” said van Vlissingen. </p>
